        <h2>Welcome to <b>The Hackers</b> - like the traitors, but with a lot more code...</h2>
        <p>The Traitors is a game where contestants compete in tasks, argue - and murder. Among the "normal" players - called Faithfuls - are Traitors, who secretly meet every night and decide on someone to kill.</p>
        <br>
        <p>New for 2026, is a new game - <b>The Hackers.</b> With the same principle as the traitors, but instead of tasks, all the players are working to build an app. However - The UnEthicals (equivilent of traitors) are trying to stop the faithful - by adding bugs and useless features. Every day, one player will be voted out, based on potentially suspicious activity - but the Ethical (faithful) better act fast, because each night the UnEthical will choose one Ethical to be deleted - they won't be able to contribute any more.</p>
