                        The Traitors is a game where contestants compete in tasks, argue — and murder.
                        Among the "normal" players, called <strong>Faithfuls</strong>, are hidden
                        <strong>Traitors</strong>, who secretly meet every night and decide on someone to kill.

                        and vote out suspected Traitors before it is too late.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Traitors:</strong> Blend in, act helpful, and quietly remove players one by one while 
                        steering suspicion anywhere but themselves.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Hackers</strong> takes the core idea of The Traitors and drops it into a software project.
                    Instead of physical tasks, all players are working together to build an app. On the surface, everyone
                    is part of one big dev team. Underneath, the sabotage is very real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>UnEthicals</strong> (equivalent of Traitors) try to stop the Ethicals by adding bugs and useless features.
                    Every day, one player is voted out based on suspicious activity. Each night, the UnEthicals secretly
                    delete one Ethical from the project.
